There's a simple rich text editor as well as markdown. **Or**... you can work locally e.g.
* clone the repo
* run npm install (get a hugo binary under node_modules/hugo-bin/vendor/hugo)
* edit markdown in your IDE
* npm run build:hugo (to generate 'dist')
* http-server dist (to serve locally)
* commit and push..
